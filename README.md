# Parkinson’s Disease Prediction Project

## About the Project

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and speech.  
Voice changes are often among the early symptoms, making voice data a valuable resource for early detection.

In this project, I worked with a biomedical voice dataset containing features extracted from voice recordings of healthy individuals and Parkinson’s patients.  
The objective is to predict the presence of Parkinson’s disease by analyzing these voice features using machine learning techniques.

The project involves:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- Exploring the data through visualizations to identify important patterns.
- Preparing the data for model building.
- Setting up a framework for future model training and evaluation.

This project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can contribute to early detection of medical conditions, potentially assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosis.

## Features Used
- Average vocal frequency (MDVP:Fo(Hz))
- Variation in vocal frequency (Jitter)
- Variation in amplitude (Shimmer)
- Measures of noise-to-harmonics ratio
- Other vocal signal properties

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading:** Imported the Parkinson’s disease dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Dropped irrelevant columns and handled missing values if any.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized feature distributions and relationships using plots.
4. **Data Preparation:** Selected features and labels for machine learning tasks.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (optional for modeling)
