# Parkinson’s Disease Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting Parkinson’s disease using biomedical voice measurements.  
I worked with a dataset containing various voice-related features, cleaned and preprocessed the data, visualized important patterns, and prepared the data for machine learning models.  
The goal is to accurately classify whether a person has Parkinson’s disease based on their vocal biomarkers.

## Features Used
- Various vocal measurements like frequency, jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio.
- Biomedical voice signals data collected from healthy and Parkinson’s patients.

## Steps Involved
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Data Preparation for Machine Learning
5. (Optional) Model Training

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
